# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
 - The purpose of this project was to build a webpage where users could go to interact with UFO data.  Users should be able to filter data based on inputs provided and see only the results that they want to see.  

## Results

### Performing a Search

- By Date

- Users can filter the data by date by providing the m/d/yyy into the date input.  This filters down to only 1 specific date. 

- By City

- Users can view data for one specific city by inputing that city as a search parameter

- Multiple Filters

- Users can apply multiple filters to narrow down their results to exactly what they are looking for. 

## Summary
### Drawback
- One drawback is you have to know what you are wanting to filter by because all of the inputs are a free text field.  If that was a dropdown or a picklist the user could do some more exploration of the data without knowing exact values. 
### Further development
- I would recommend that further development allow for users to select data from a dropdown or have a picklist where they can select more than one option.  For example maybe a user wants to see data for their city and a few surrounding cities, allowing them to select multiple would be a great feature. 
- Additionally having the ability to select a date range would be useful.  Maybe I want to see data for a whole month or a specific week of time.  Specific dates are maybe a little to granular.
